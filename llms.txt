# odin2

`odin2` implements a high-level language for describing and implementing
ordinary differential equations and difference equations in R. It
provides a “[domain specific
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)” (DSL)
which *looks* like R but is compiled directly to C++, using
[`dust2`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/dust2/) to solve your system and to
provide an interface to particle filters. You can then use
[`monty`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/monty/) to fit your models using
MCMC.

- The DSL is *declarative* reflecting the mathematical nature of the
  equations.
- It includes support for equations that involve vectors, matrices and
  higher dimensional arrays (up to 8!), including a high-level array
  indexing notation that removes the need for explicit looping.
- Supports both discrete-time (possibly stochastic) models, as well as
  continuous-time ODE models.
- Interpolation functions can be used to include time-varying quantities
  into the model (piecewise constant, linear and spline interpolation is
  supported).
- The equations are analysed before compilation so that parts that do
  not depend on time are not included in time-dependent calculations.
- Supports user-supplied parameters for any part of the system.
- Supports a large number of mathematical functions (see the [functions
  vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2/articles/functions.html) for
  a complete list).

## Documentation

The best place to start for most people is probably the [odin & monty
book](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin-monty/) which walks through odin
and its context within a wider set of statistical packages.

The package also includes a number of vignettes and other documentation:

- See [the introductory
  vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2/articles/odin2.html) for a
  tutorial-style introduction to `odin2`
- A [tutorial-style
  guide](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2/articles/fitting.html) to using
  `odin2` with `dust2` and `monty` to fit models to data
- A [reference-style
  guide](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2/articles/functions.html) to the
  syntax and supported functions
- If you have used [`odin` version 1](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin)
  before, see the [migration
  guide](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2/articles/migrating.html) to see
  what has changed.

Because `odin2` compiles to `dust2`, see [its
documentation](https://mrc-ide.github.io/dust2) and in particular the
[list of functions that you can
use](https://mrc-ide.github.io/dust2/reference/index.html)

Because `odin2` is designed for use with `monty`, see [its
documentation](https://mrc-ide.github.io/monty/), especially when
fitting models to data or working with the random number generators for
stochastic models.

## Roadmap

The package is currently ready for use for adventurous users. It will
eventually become [`odin`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin) and replace
that version on CRAN (i.e., it will simply become version 2.0.0 of
`odin`, and `odin2` will cease to be a package name that you will see).
It also replaces [odin.dust](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin.dust). It
exists separately for now to facilitate development and use alongside
the original `odin`.

See [this
list](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2/articles/migrating.html#missing-features)
of missing features from version 1 of odin before using.

Over the next few months we will be expanding the automatic
differentiation support, generating code for other host languages and
improving the ergonomics of the package.

## Installation

Please install from our r-universe:

``` r
install.packages(
  "odin2",
  repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

If you prefer, you can install from GitHub with `remotes`:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mrc-ide/odin2", upgrade = FALSE)
```
