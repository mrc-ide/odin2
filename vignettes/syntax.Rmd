This vignette describes the odin syntax and supported functions.

# General structure

`odin` is a "[Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)"; a mini-language that solves a specific problem; in this case representing systems of difference or differential equations.  It is syntactically R (i.e., it can be parsed with R's parser) but it is not itself R.  Only a subset of expressions and syntax are supported.

Every line in `odin` code must be an **assignment** or a **relationship** (there are some minor exceptions below).
